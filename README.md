# Become a Bell Ringer Website

## Introduction

![Screenshot of Homepage](/screenshots/screenshot_home.PNG)

<!-- VIEW THE LIVE PROJECT HERE-->

Bell ringing, and campanology, is a hobby that is struggling with dwindling numbers, and yet offers an experience that is surprisingly welcoming and accommodating to a range of people, particularly those who may not fit in with typical sporting or other physically demanding activities.  
The activity would benefit from a central website that would offer a basic introduction to the hobby, some key information about it historically, and a contact form that could provide information about opportunities in an individual's area.

## UX
---
### Goals 
##### User goals 
The central audience of this website is people who are interested in finding out how to take up bell ringing as a hobby.
The user goal of the website would be to find out who to contact in their local area to find out information about local ringing groups.

##### Industry/ Business Goals
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers (CCCBR) is the primary business relating to the website.  The business goal of the website would be to provide a gateway for new recruits to try bell ringing as a hobby.

### User Stories
#### As a **potential recruit** looking at the website, I want:

* Large, intuitive and easy navigation that is consistent throughout the site, so I know how to get the key information I want, and how to find out more if I want (through links to external sites, or a contact email address or phone number/ form).
* Some basic information on the subject of bell ringing, such as key terms to know if I go to an introductory practice night in a local tower.
* An idea of the theory and study of bell ringing, to see what I can expect to have to study.
* Information/ ideas of what the ringing community does socially as well as ring bells, to see if it is a social scene I would be interested in.
* A basic background into the history of ringing and how it has shaped communities.

#### As a **member of the CCCBR** endorsing this website, I want:
* It to provide an easily accessible hub for people to potentially find out about, and link with, their local ringing networks, which could ultimately increase the awareness of bell ringing as a bobby and increase the number of ringers.
* It to be easily accessible to a range of ages and demographics – potentially children aged 11-16, university students, or older individuals in retirement.
* It to have a clear, intuitive UI and provide a simple experience so people do not get overwhelmed with information.


## Design
---
### Colour Scheme
* The two main colours used are #230007 and #DDB967 (#7B3335 used as a darker shade of the second for hover effect on a button).  These were chosen as they provided strong contrasts for the text and images to be seen clearly, but were not obtrusive and would not detract from the main purpose of the website.  Originally I thought of simply using a light grey #696969 and white, though this did not have enough visual appeal.
---
### Typography
* The Fira Sans font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Fira Sans is a clean font that is simple and easily legible, but also classy; this was chosen as it has a professional and minimalist feel, without feeling overly showy.
---
### Imagery
* The large, background hero image was chosen to appeal to the key audiences (see user stories).  A variety of images showing the activity of bell ringing and also the social side was chosen for the gallery, again to appeal to a variety of people in the target audiences.

### Wireframes 
Balsamiq was used to design the wireframes for this project.  There were the following amendments made to the original wireframes that resulted in the completed project:
1. Home Page - an extra heading, with link to contact.html, was added, to make the goal of the website easier for users to complete.  Also, an animation of a bell being rung was added, to give a basic idea how the mechanics of a church bell work.
2. Gallery Page - for desktops, columns were split into three, to give a satisfying sense of symmetry, and dropped to two columns for mobile.  This made the organisation of the images less chaotic and busy.
3. About Page - the layout was changed to simply timeline on left, image on right - having a split timeline and two images in a grid, as shown in the desktop wireframe, was needlessly complex and did not look right.  The final design is less cluttered, and looks tidy and clean.

## Features
### Existing features
* Responsive on all device sizes – allows users to access website in a clear, simple and accessible format on a variety of formats, including desktop/ laptop, tablet or smartphone.
* A form that allows the user to submit their location and receive an email giving key information about local towers and tower captains if they wish to get in contact.
### Features left to implement
* A section on key terms of ringing, and basic theory/ campanology could be useful, to introduce potential recruits to the theories/ methods they would be expected to learn once they can handle a bell.  This would require research into what would be deemed useful knowledge as an introduction, and could include:
    *Key terms
    *Basic methods
    *Audio clips of different methods
    *The ‘about’ section which includes several key dates of ringing could be expanded if it was decided that it offered enough value to the website’s goals.


## Technologies Used
* Motorola G6 – embedded camera:
    *The developer’s camera was used to take various photos of the local church to use as the Hero Image and various photos in the Gallery page of the website.

## Languages Used
* HTML5
* CSS3

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
1. Bootstrap 5.0.0:
    * Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.
2.	Hover pseudoclass in CSS:
    * Hover was used for each item in the navbar to add an underline element while being hovered over; this would add an element of responsiveness to the user whilst using the site.
3.	Google Fonts:
    * Google fonts were used to import the Fira Sans font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
4.	Font Awesome:
    * Font Awesome was used on all pages in the footer to make the links to social media more aesthetically pleasing, and to help improve the UX.
5.	Git
    * Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
6.	GitHub:
    * GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
7.	Balsamiq:
    * Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
### As a potential recruit looking at the website, I want:
* Large, intuitive and easy navigation that is consistent throughout the site, so I know how to get the key information I want, and how to find out more if I want (through links to external sites, or a contact email address or phone number/ form).
    * A simple, clear navigation bar has been created with social links on the bottom of each page to clearly indicate to the user what lies where.  There is a form to fill in that a user can submit to receive information by email about local towers/ info.
* Some basic information on the subject of bell ringing, such as key terms to know if I go to an introductory practice night in a local tower, and an idea what I can expect to have to study.
    * This is something that has been left as a feature left to implement, as the research that would be involved (e.g. working out what level of ringing would be appropriate to pique a potential recruit’s interest, without intimidating them) is beyond the scale of this project.
* Information/ ideas of what the ringing community does socially as well as ring bells, to see if it is a social scene I would be interested in.
    * A gallery of photos demonstrating the activities bell ringers take part in (meals out, drinks, group exercise) has been included to demonstrate what the social side of ringing can offer.
* A basic background into the history of ringing and how it has shaped communities.
    * A basic page with some key dates and facts has been included to given some background to how long ringing has been part of communities for.  An expansion of this section could be another opportunity to develop the website.
### As a member of the CCCBR (Central Council of Church Bell Ringers) endorsing this website, I want:
* It to provide an easily accessible hub for people to potentially find out about, and link with, their local ringing networks, which could ultimately increase the awareness of bell ringing as a hobby and increase the number of ringers.
    * When designing the website, it was kept in mind that the most likely people looking at it probably were those already thinking of taking up ringing as a hobby (often it is taken up through contact with friends or family, or word-of-mouth).  Therefore, it was important not to include too much superfluous information which would possibly put people off; rather, a clean, simple site was designed with the ability to take people’s contact email via a form and email back key information.
* It to be easily accessible to a range of ages and demographics – potentially children aged 11-16, university students, or older individuals in retirement.
    * A basic, simple site was created, not one that was overly brash or ‘noisy’ but rather one that was understated; in this way it was designed to appeal to a wide age range.
* It to have a clear, intuitive UI and provide a simple experience so people do not get overwhelmed with information.
    * Again, a key feature was simplicity, ease-of-use and responsiveness on a range of devices so as not to prevent someone accessing or using the site purely because of their device.
